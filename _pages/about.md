👋 Hi there! I’m a software developer and student at the University at Buffalo.

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's degree in the field of Software Systems and Algorithm Design.

📚 Like many others, I’ve taken challenging courses and struggled through them, but ultimately felt grateful for the knowledge gained.

📚 I've kept a 4.0 GPA during my entire Master's program thanks to my constant hard work and deep passion for the subject.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Software Developer** at the SS&C Eze. \
There I worked on building mobile applications in React Native and desktop applications in .NET for the company.

💻 As a developer, I’ve had the opportunity to experience the full spectrum of development: from adding new features and fixing bugs in large codebases, to building new applications from the ground up and watching them grow, to witnessing redevelopment of large codebases in new tech stack.

As a developer, I've had a broad range of experiences, spanning from enhancing existing features and resolving issues in extensive codebases, to crafting brand-new applications from scratch and adding constant updates and features. I've also been a part of projects where we've overhauled substantial codebases with fresh technology stacks.

## 📚 Community Contributions
As a software engineer, I've worked on diverse projects in both academic and industry settings, acquiring valuable knowledge and skills in software development. My passion for sharing this expertise led me to create a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@stumbled001/videos) channel where I regularly post videos explaining solutions to everyday LeetCode challenges.😊
