* Implemented the Raft consensus algorithm as described in the research paper ‘In Search of an
Understandable Consensus Algorithm’ by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.
* Developed a distributed system using the Raft algorithm to ensure data consistency and fault tolerance.
* Optimized the performance of the Raft algorithm by implementing leader election, log replication, and safety mechanisms.
* Conducted extensive testing to ensure the correctness and reliability of the Raft implementation.
