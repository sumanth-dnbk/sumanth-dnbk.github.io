* Devised a disease spread simulation to evaluate performance gains through parallel processing. 
* Executed simulation using parallel algorithm on a supercomputer, reducing runtime by 90% compared to sequential algorithm. 
* Conducted a detailed analysis of impact of communication overhead on system performance as number of processors utilized in parallel processing increased and identified 64 cores as optimal.
