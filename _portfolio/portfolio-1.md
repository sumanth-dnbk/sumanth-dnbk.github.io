title: "Raft protocol for distributed consesnus"
excerpt: "Implementation of Raft using Golang to achieve distributed consensus <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
collection: portfolio
---

* Implemented the Raft consensus algorithm as described in the research paper ‘In Search of an
Understandable Consensus Algorithm’ by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.
* Developed a distributed system using the Raft algorithm to ensure data consistency and fault tolerance.
* Optimized the performance of the Raft algorithm by implementing leader election, log replication, and safety mechanisms.
* Conducted extensive testing to ensure the correctness and reliability of the Raft implementation.

title: "Kademlia: a distributed hash table algorithm"
excerpt: "Implementation of Kademlia using Golang to create a distributed hash table <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
collection: portfolio
---

* Developed a peer-to-peer (P2P) network communication system using the Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm.
* Built a distributed hash table using Golang for content addressing using principle of Kademlia.
* provided a way for multiple computers to self-organize into a network, communicate, and share resources, all without a central registry or lookup.
* Created a distributed system for key-value storage and retrieval that is scalable and fault-tolerant using the Kademlia algorithm.
* Enhanced the performance of the Kademlia algorithm by implementing efficient mechanisms for routing, node lookup, and data replication.
* Performed thorough testing to ensure the Kademlia implementation was correct, reliable, and scalable.

excerpt: "Simulation of spread of a disease ,across groups with varying spread and caution parameters, using MPI to understand Amdhal's and Gustafson's law<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
collection: portfolio
---
* Devised a disease spread simulation to evaluate performance gains through parallel processing.
* Used MPI library to run simulation leveraging multiple CPU processors at university's super computer
* Identified affect of travel, safety and contaminant factors on rate of disease spread among groups.
