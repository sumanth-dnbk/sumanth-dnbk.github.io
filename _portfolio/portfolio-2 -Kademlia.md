* Developed a peer-to-peer (P2P) network communication system using the Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm.
* Built a distributed hash table using Golang for content addressing using principle of Kademlia.
* provided a way for multiple computers to self-organize into a network, communicate, and share resources, all without a central registry or lookup.
* Created a distributed system for key-value storage and retrieval that is scalable and fault-tolerant using the Kademlia algorithm.
* Enhanced the performance of the Kademlia algorithm by implementing efficient mechanisms for routing, node lookup, and data replication.
* Performed thorough testing to ensure the Kademlia implementation was correct, reliable, and scalable.
